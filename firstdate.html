                    Even if it was the first time we laid eyes on each other, not through the pixels of iPhone screens and a barely-surviving internet connection, it felt like looking into the eyes of someone I’ve known for my entire life. Nervous as I was, stepping out of the bus with my heart bumping in my chest - I was finally coming home. The second you had your arms around me, the world melted away, and we were the only two people in a crowd of a bustling metropolis.

                <h3 style="color: black">
                    Escaping the hustle and bustle of a city center to a quainter part of town, accompanied by the perfect weather, was just the start of a day I would never forget. To be able to come to your hometown - see the sights and paths you walked through every day, hearing anecdotes about your night out with your friends as we eat lunch and go through the park, I always had to stop myself from possibly tearing my facial muscles from “excessive smiling syndrome”. The sights were beautiful, your hand wrapped around mine as we made our way around the wide expanse of nature and all its blessings, yet still, funnily enough - I couldn’t keep my eyes off you. Always making sure I was okay at every moment, letting me rest as I was tired despite the heat literally puncturing you. I’m truly thankful to know that you care, silently shown by subtle acts of pushing me away from the car paths and checking on me ever so often - I won’t ever forget how you made me feel like a princess.
                </h3>
                <h3 style="color: black">
                    Seeing you genuinely frustrated for the first time was quite endearing if I were to be completely honest - especially being able to see how hard you tried to get us into the amusement park, with the unhelpful circumstances and all. The lengths you went through to make sure our first date was an unforgettable one, “I always try hard”, just like you say every time, and I really believe you! Thankfully we got in, though. I think fate really wanted us to have the best time that day. Even if we got sick from all the rides, even actual neck pain at some point - I still had the goofiest smile on my face since I was finally hand-in-hand with someone I truly love. I wish we took more pictures, though! (We’ll have to do it next time >.<). Despite walking through the amusement park for literal hours, I didn’t find myself being tired at all! I only wanted to spend more time with you, as I always do.
                </h3>
                <h3 style="color: black">
                    As the night came to a close, it was finally our first time drinking together - as well as the first time you saw me (almost, not completely!) drunk. Here’s to hoping that this night will be one of many! The food was amazing, and I always trust your judgment when it comes to food - and your undying love for all things mala. I wish I slept more that day so I could hold my drink better, but I was glad to see that you took me back safely, even if I were sloppy and uncoordinated, to say the least. To end the night with soft ballads in the background, your arms around me and listening you whisper the sweetest things into my ear, it was a victory that I was able to keep my face from turning to a complete tomato. As I looked into your eyes that night, the very ones that I always tell you I love so much, I knew that I was grateful to fate and whatever celestial being out there to have brought us together in such weird and testing times. I couldn’t ask for someone better, and I would never do so. I love you.
